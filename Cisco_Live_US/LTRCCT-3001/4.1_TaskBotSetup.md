# Introduction

## Lab Objective
In this lab we will be creating a task bot using the bot builder in Webex Connect. We will be creating Intents and Entities that might be coming in the requests from end-customers. Based on this information, our task bot will be able to automatically provide an answer of handoff to a real agent.


### Pre-requisites

1. You have received the access credentials with a full admin access 
2. Lab 2 should be completed successfully and chat routing to agent is working

### AI Terminology

- **Utterances**: Anything a user says to the bot​

- **Intents**: Task or action that the user wants to perform​

- **Entities**: Metadata that specifies the user's intent​

- **Responses**: Message sent from the bot to converse to the user​

- **Fallback**: The state when a bot is unable to understand the utterance​

- **Handover**: Bot stops processing messages and transfers to an agent

- **NLU (Natural Language Understanding)**: engines used to assess the intent from the consumer inputs and respond with an accurate response


## Use Case
-  Check if an item is in stock
   - Entities:
     - StockItem (Custom list): widgets, bobbles
     - Color (Custom List): green, red, yellow, blue, purple, silver, orange
    - Intent:
      - Check Stock
    - Utterances:
      - Do you have green bobbles?
      - Do you have red widgets?

     - Color (Custom List): green, red, yellow, blue, purple, silver, orange

## Step 2. Create Intents
- Click Training -> Intents -> Create Intent

- Name your intent (Example: Check Stock)

- Add utterances (you can copy the ones mentioned in the Use Case, Please find them below)
  - Utterances:
       - Do you have green bobbles?
       - Do you have red widgets?

- In the slots section on right side, click on Link Entity and select the entities that you just added (StockItem and Color)
 > Click the **Required** checkbox.
 > 
>  Select or create a new **Template Key** that will be used to prompt when there is missing information (Example: Fallback message)

<br>

   
- Double Click on words which represent **Entities**, a pop up opens -> select the correct entity in the drop down and click save.
- Repeat it for all the 4 words which you see in 2 sentenses -> red, widgets, green, bobbles. (Refer to the video below)

- In the **Response** Section Click on final template key
> Select or create a Template key which will be used to respond to the intent once required slots are filled. (Example: Thank you)
> 
 >Toggle reset slots after completion to True


- Save the configuration and click on Train in **Training** section.

## Step 3. Create Responses
- Go to Responses 

- Locate the templates that you selected(Example:Fallback message) when some Entity information is missing
  - Add some responses that will ask the customer to enter the correct information (Example: Please mention both color and the product you are looking for?)

- Locate the template which you created to respond to your intent once required slots are filled (Example : Thank you)
  - Populate the response with the Entities and Intents that you will be using as variables. 
  - Example: 
      - Color identified ${entity.Color}
      - Product identified ${entity.StockItem}
      - Intent identified ${intent} 

- Locate the Greetings template
	- Update the response to include - Hello ${consumerData.name} 

- Click Update and Make Live

## Step 4. Testing Bot

- Switch back to Training section

- Select Mindmeld as NLU Engine from right top.
	- This is only needed if you have configured Custom List values separated by commad.
	- If you defined the values as different entries or you have set synonims, you can use Swiftmatch

- Click Preview and test your bot by using training phrases.
