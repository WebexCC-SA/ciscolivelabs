> The default channel type is Telephony.

> Service Level Threshold -->Enter the duration for which a customer request can be in a queue before the system flags it as outside the service level. If the agent completes a customer service request within this time interval, the system considers it within the service level.

> Time Zone (Routing Strategies Only)

    (Optional) Enter the time zone that routing strategies use for this entry point.

The default time zone is the Tenant's time zone.

7. upon selecting **Location** all number associate to that location will be
   available for mapping, choose available **Number** and map it with the **Entry point** created at step 4

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/Portal_DN_EP2.jpg" width="1000" />

8. Next step is creating a flow, to create first flow click on **Routing Strategies** from the portal and click on **Flows** and click **New**

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow1.jpg" width="900" />

9. Give any name and click on **Start Building Flow**

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow2.jpg" width="900" />

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow3.jpg" width="900" />

10. From the Flow Pallete, drag and drop **Play Message Node** and **Disconnect Node** and connect all nodes

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow5.jpg" width="900" />

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow6.jpg" width="900" />

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_flow7.jpg" width="900" />

13. Routing Strategies tags the flow created with an Entry point, to create routing strategies click on **Routing Strategies-->New Strategy**

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_RS_1.jpg" width="300" />

14. Create a Routing strategy which act as a Bridge between an EntryPoint and Flow

<img align="middle" src="Images/Lab0/portal_RS_3.jpg" width="1000" />

> For each entry point, you should create a set of default routing strategies that cover all time intervals. In addition, you can schedule an alternate strategy beyond the default strategy for any time interval. For example, EP 1 could have a BusyHourStrategy for the normal day shift and an OffHoursStrategy for non-business hours.

> Flag the normal daily schedule as the default strategy. You can create a non-default strategy, such as a holiday schedule for a time interval that overlaps the default strategy. A strategy that is not flagged as default overrides a default strategy and is used as an exception to the default schedule. This means that the system first checks for a strategy that is not flagged as default, and if none exists, the system uses the default strategy.

15. As a last step make sure the routing strategy becomes **Current**
