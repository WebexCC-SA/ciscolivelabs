# Introduction

### Recap

In the first 4 Lab, we Learned

0. Bring the contact into Webex Contact Center and hear welcome message
1.  Queue the contact to Live Agent after hearing welcome prompt
2.  provide Menu option and an Opt-Out options to customer and validate CallBack Functionality
3.  HTTP based Data Dip to external WebServices to Pull Customer Information and POP that on Agent Desktop
4.  Dip to external database and validate if customer is premium/ Platinum customer and connect the contact immediately to Agent using Advanced Skill Based Routing
5.  When premium customer calls back, connect the contact back to preferred or last routed agent

### Lab Objective

In this section, we will go over the steps that are required to do External Data DIP to validate customer is premium or not, if yes, connect the contact to
preferred Agent

1. External Data Dip to 3rd party Web Services
2. Parsing the JSON to validate the customer is premium
3. Connect to premium customer to preferred Agent using QueuetoAgent node

> we are going to take this lab forward from Lab4, by copying the same Lab and adding a condition node to check if the customer is premium customer, if yes
> customer will be routed immediately to last agent routed based using QueuetoAgent
> Node
