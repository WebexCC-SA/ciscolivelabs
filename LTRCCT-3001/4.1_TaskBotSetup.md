# Introduction
In this portion of the lab, we will be configuring the Webex Connect Task bot itself.  We have three different use cases that we are going to complete so that we can take some of the load off of our customer service team.  We will be collecting information, deciding if we need to handoff to an agent, making API calls, and relaying information back to the user.

## Tools we will be using
- Postman
- Bot Builder
- requestcatcher.com
- jsonpathfinder.com
- mockapi.io
- Webex Connect Flow Builder


## Use Cases
1. Check if an item is in stock
   - Entities:
     - Stock Item: Custom list: Widget, Bobble
     - Color: Custom List: Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Silver, Orange
    - Intent:
      - Check Stock
    - Utterances:
      - Do you have green bobbles?
      - Do you have red widgets?
2. Change my order
   - Entities:
     - Email address (we already asked for this)
     - Order number (string)
   - Intent: 
     - Update Order
   - Utterances:
     - be creative 
   - Let's assume that an agent will need to work with the customer after we gather the Entities

- Open [Variable Documentation](https://help.imiconnect.io/docs/response-designer#list-of-common-response-variables) in a new tab.
- Locate the template which you created to respond to your intent
  - Populate the response with the Entities and Intents that you will be using as variables. (Example: ${entity.Color} ${intent})
- Locate the Greetings template
