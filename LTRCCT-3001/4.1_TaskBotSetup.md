# Introduction
In this portion of the lab, we will be configuring the Webex Connect Task bot itself.  We have three different use cases that we are going to complete so that we can take some of the load off of our customer service team.  We will be collecting information, deciding if we need to handoff to an agent, making API calls, and relaying information back to the user.

## Tools we will be using
- Postman
- Bot Builder
- requestcatcher.com
- jsonpathfinder.com
- mockapi.io
- Webex Connect Flow Builder


## Use Cases
1. Check if an item is in stock
   - Entities:
     - Stock Item: Custom list: Widget, Bobble
     - Color: Custom List: Green, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Silver, Orange
    - Intent:
      - Check Stock
    - Utterances:
      - Do you have green bobbles?
      - Do you have red widgets?
2. Change my order
   - Entities:
     - Email address (we already asked for this)
     - Order number (string)
   - Intent: 
     - Update Order
   - Utterances:
     - be creative 
   - Let's assume that an agent will need to work with the customer after we gather the Entities 


# Lab Section
## Step 1. Create Task bot and Entities

- Navigate to the Webex Connect portal (https://cl2podXX.imiconnect.io)
- Click App tray -> Bot Builder
- Select the Task bots option at the top of the screen
- Click the new Task Bot button, give the bot a name and click done
- Click Training -> Entities
- For Each Entity:
  - Click Create Entity
    > Name: name of entity (don't use spaces)
    >
    > Entity Type: pick data type
    >
    > If using a Custom List:
    >
    >> Populate the list with values.
    >> 
    >> Add any Synonyms that are necessary
    

## Step 2. Create Intents
- Click Training ->Intents
- Click Create Intent
  > Name your intent (Example: Check Stock)
  >
  > Add utterances 
  >
  >> Create a phrase similar to what a user might enter.
  >>
    >>  In the Slots section:
    >>
    >>> Click link entity 
    >>>
    >>> Select any entities that you will use for this intent
    >>>
    >>> Click the **Required** checkbox if they are required
    >>>
    >>> Select or create a new **Template Key** (Will be used to prompt for missing information)
    >>
    >
    > Click on words which represent **Entities** 
    >
    > <img src="images\Lab4_Map_Entity.gif">
    >   
    >In the **Response** Section Click on final template key
    >> Select or create a Template key which will be used to respond to the intent once required slots are filled. (Example: Lookup Item)
    >
- Toggle reset slots after completion to True
- Click Save.
- Click Train and supply a reason for training.


## Step 3. Create Responses
-  Click Responses <img src="images\Lab4_Responses_menu.PNG" height="25"> 
- Locate the templates which you created for entity slot filling 
  - Add some responses that will prompt the customer to enter in the connect information. (Example: Which Color?)
- Open [Variable Documentation](https://help.imiconnect.io/docs/response-designer#list-of-common-response-variables) in a new tab.
- Locate the template which you created to respond to your intent
  - Populate the response with the Entities and Intents that you will be using as variables. (Example: ${entity.Color} ${intent})
- Locate the Greetings template
  - Update the response to include ${consumerData}
    - We will make some adjustments during the testing
- Click Update
- Click Make Live


## Step 4. Testing Bot

- Click back to the training section
- Click Preview
- Test your bot by using training phrases.


 

## Step 5. Preparing for the API calls
- Launch Postman
- Import the lookup for Widgets and Bobbles
  
  - ```curl --location --request GET 'https://629f77cc8b939d3dc2987fa4.mockapi.io/api/v1/Widget?color=red'```


  - ```curl --location --request GET 'https://629f77cc8b939d3dc2987fa4.mockapi.io/api/v1/Bobble?color=red'```


- For each cURL:
  > File > Import > Raw test
  >
  > Paste the cURL command into the text area
  >
  > Click Continue
  >
  > Click Import
  > 
  > Click Send in Postman
  >
  > Open a new browser tab to [JSON Path Finder](https://jsonpathfinder.com)
  >
  > Copy the entire JSON payload from Postman 
  >
  > Paste the payload into the left pane of JSON Path Finder
  > 
  > Click the stockcount node on the right side of the screen and copy the path
  >
  > Replace the leading x with $

- Open a new browser tab to [Request Catcher](https://requestcatcher.com)
