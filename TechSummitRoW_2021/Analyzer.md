## Important Lab Note

This lab was created with existing Supervisor Profiles as well as Team designations.  The content may make reference to this or direct the user to use these designations to make changes as part of the learning process and lab goals.  Additionally, there may be previous lab dependencies as some labs will build on the completion of other labs so it is recommended to complete these labs in order.

**Example:** 
- Lab may state to change the Supervisor Profile for your student number.  Supervisor Team 3 for example.  This profile will not exist on your allocated tenant unless you create the profile.

`Resolution` of these designations can be accomplished with some of these suggestions which should be done prior to going through these labs.
- Previous videos specified creating `Team1_TS` and if those were done then supplement the training video with using a team you created earlier.
- If no Supervisor Profile was previously created and no users were designated as a Supervisor, follow the guideline below
	- In Control Hub under Users, ensure that at least one of your users is designated as a Supervisor
	- In WebexCC ensure that a Supervisor Profile is assigned to that user.  You may create your own supervisor profile or use the stock profile in the system.
	- Alternatively if following the video is desired but no supervisors exist, you may be able to change administrator profiles but best case is using a supervisor profile.

### OR
- Ignore or overlook the specific lab instructions as you see fit.  If this option is chosen, it may mean limited success with some labs that may build on the existence of the team and supervisor profiles
- Lab videos are still viable learning regardless of whether your allocated tenant has these configurations


## Lab Objective

This lab is designed to give you basic understanding of Analyzer, user interface features , how execute stock reports and use them to create custom reports per your need. In these videos the `lab goal` is familiarization of the product and terminology. 

We will also be creating two new reports (one for Call and one for agent) to capture relevant information and then will use these reports in a dashboard, while doing this we will learn about capabilities and features you can use to capture the required insights.


## Pre-requisite

1. Admin or supervisor credential with Analytics access in user profile
2. Labs will be more successful once agent data has been created using voice, email and chat.
