# Introduction

## Lab Objective

WxCC Lab pods are assigned to each partner org and labs are structured in such a way to allow attendees to build out a tenant end to end.  Some lab elements have already been completed but will still include a video reference on how those elements were created.  Partner orgs with more than one attendee may wish to share the lab build as a group or assign tasks to individuals.  Some labs may also be able to be duplicated if attendees wish to go through the full process individually.

**Example:**
Bob may wish to create EP_voice_bob, Q_voice_bob, RS_voice_bob, etc... while others may also do the same.  This does cause an overhead of configuration and not all elements can be duplicated in this way effectively but this could allow individual contribution.  Doing this however would require the main DN be reconfigured to point to the new EP. Please direct any questions to Lab Admins.

### Basic Instructions

Labs will have 2 parts - a document and a video link.  The document is an online link given to you at the opening of each lab.  **Only labs that have been open are available.  This information is normally released following related training and attendees will be advised at that time.**

Once each lab document has been released it will show up on the **Lab Library** document.  The document has basic overview instructions and a video.  Start and pause the video while you build out the elements for best results.

Participants can choose to download and install the WebEx Calling App for Agents, Admins or Supervisors and make on-net calls.
